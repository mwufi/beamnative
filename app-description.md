Ara is an AI assistant that also allows you to connect with the world.

## Features

### HOME PAGE

When you open the app, you'll see a home page just for you. It'll feature cards like:
- Todos
- "You might like" - news articles, or other content
- "What's happening" - updates from your friends, or other statuses
- Some follow ups from Ara. For example, if you previously talked about LOTR, there'll be a card with a LOTR quote, or some book recommendations.
- A button you can click into to "see more recommendations" - this will show a full-screen swiping card view (carousel) of recommendations.

The cards, if you click into them, will open up into a full-screen chat view, with Ara's recommendation as the first message. "So, I see you like this. Would you like to know more?"

On the top right corner, you can click into your inbox. This will show a list of all your chats.

### Discover

In "Explore", you can find updates from your friends & discover new people. It's like Instagram. You can see posts from famous people, or other people you don't know. If you click on their profile, however, there's an option to chat with them. Clicking this will start a new chat with them.

### INBOX (not a tab, since you can navigate to it from the home page)

All the conversations that you started, either with friends or with your Ara. You can also see Groups.

There's also a separate tab for "Requests". This is where you can see all the people who want to chat with you. (they've chatted with your Ara)

### Ara

In "Ara", you can ask Ara anything. This should look pretty blank, like a ChatGPT interface. Once you enter something, Ara will respond.

### Me (settings)

In "Me", you can change your profile information, preferences, and other settings.

## Theme & Look

The app should be dark themed.
Use minimalistic design. I like gradients, but not too much.
