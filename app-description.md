# Ara

Ara is an AI assistant that also allows you to connect with the world.

## Features

### HOME PAGE

When you open the app, you'll see a home page just for you. It'll feature cards like:
- Todos
- "You might like" - news articles, or other content
- "What's happening" - updates from your friends, or other statuses
- Some follow ups from Ara. For example, if you previously talked about LOTR, there'll be a card with a LOTR quote, or some book recommendations.
- A button you can click into to "see more recommendations" - this will show a full-screen swiping card view (carousel) of recommendations.

The cards, if you click into them, will open up into a full-screen chat view, with Ara's recommendation as the first message. "So, I see you like this. Would you like to know more?"

On the top right corner, you can click into your inbox. This will show a list of all your chats.

### Discover

In "Explore", you can find updates from your friends & discover new people. It's like Instagram. You can see posts from famous people, or other people you don't know. If you click on their profile, however, there's an option to chat with them. Clicking this will start a new chat with them.

**NEW: The Discover tab will have a segmented control at the top with three options:**
- **Feed** - The regular social feed (default view)
- **Events** - Community events, meetups, and activities
- **Challenges** - Weekly challenges and rewards
### INBOX (not a tab, since you can navigate to it from the home page)

All the conversations that you started, either with friends or with your Ara. You can also see Groups.

There's also a separate tab for "Requests". This is where you can see all the people who want to chat with you. (they've chatted with your Ara)

### Ara

In "Ara", you can ask Ara anything. This should look pretty blank, like a ChatGPT interface. Once you enter something, Ara will respond.

### Me (settings)

In "Me", you can change your profile information, preferences, and other settings.

## Theme & Look

The app should be dark themed.
Use minimalistic design. I like gradients, but not too much.

## Entrances to more features

### App-wide events

Sometimes, there may be app-wide notifications (e.g Ara's 1st birthday bash!). Clicking into these will show a full-screen exciting thing, with maybe a button or something!

**ENTRANCE:** These will appear as a special banner at the top of the Home screen that can be tapped to open the full event page.

### Discover - Events

I want Discover to be more than just a feed. I want it to be a place where you can find events, activities, and things to do.

Particularly, I want to create more shared experiences among Ara users, like you might be able to create/join events, or participate in polls/challenges, or join groups!

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Events" tab in the Discover section. There will also be an "Events Near You" card on the Home screen.

### Challenges & Rewards

Weekly challenges that encourage users to engage with the app in fun ways:
- "Make 3 new friends this week"
- "Have a meaningful conversation about books"
- "Share your favorite movie with the community"
Complete challenges to earn special badges and unlock exclusive Ara features.

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Challenges" tab in Discover or via the "Weekly Challenge" card on the Home screen. Also viewable in the "My Challenges" section of the Me tab.

### Community Events

Regular community-driven events like:
- Book clubs hosted by Ara
- Movie watch parties
- Group discussions on trending topics
- Virtual meetups around shared interests

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Events" tab in Discover or via event cards on the Home screen. Also viewable in the "My Events" section of the Me tab.

### Ara Labs

An experimental section where users can try out new AI features before they're released:
- Voice conversations with Ara
- Image generation capabilities
- Collaborative brainstorming tools
- Advanced recommendation algorithms

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Labs" button in the Ara tab toolbar or via the "Ara Labs" section in the Me tab.

### Personalized Learning Paths

Custom learning journeys created by Ara based on your interests:
- Language learning tracks
- Skill development programs
- Reading challenges

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Continue Learning" card on the Home screen or via the "My Learning Paths" section in the Me tab.

I want there to be a screen (perhaps when you click into a card on Home) where you can enter an experience where Ara is guiding you through an open-ended activity, like learning a new language. You can see your progress & next steps, invite friends to join, or maybe give feedback to Ara on what to put in the journey too!

### Creative Studio/Docs

A space for creating and sharing content:
- Post creation tools with AI assistance
- Collaborative story writing with Ara
- Photo editing with AI enhancements
- Meme generator with smart suggestions

**ENTRANCE:** Access through the "Create" button in the Ara tab toolbar. Long-form content and documents will be accessible through a "My Creations" section in the Me tab.

You might be able to see long generated content in a separate screen? (but i don't know where to put the entrance to this)

**ENTRANCE:** Long-form content will be accessible through a "Documents" section within the Creative Studio and also via the "My Creations" section in the Me tab.
