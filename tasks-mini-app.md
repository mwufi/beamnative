# Tasks Mini-App Specification

## Overview
The Tasks mini-app is a work-oriented screen that appears when users click into "todos" on the home page. It provides a collaborative workspace where each task functions as a group chat with both human collaborators and AI sub-agents (bots) that automatically work on tasks.

## Core Concept
- Users act as high-level conductors of tasks
- Ara sub-agents (bots) work on each todo automatically
- Tasks are collaborative spaces with both humans and AI agents
- Progress is visible and trackable within each task
- Documents and outputs generated by tasks are accessible within the task view

## User Flow

### 1. Home Page â†’ Tasks
- User clicks on "todos" from the home page
- System navigates to the Tasks mini-app (not directly to chat)

### 2. Tasks Overview Screen
- Display categorized lists of tasks (All, Inbox, Finance, Code, Recurring, etc.)
- Each task shows:
  - Task name/title
  - Status indicator (checkbox)
  - Recurrence pattern (if applicable)
  - Icons representing participants (humans and bots)
  - Visual indicator of progress/activity

### 3. Task Detail View
- User clicks on a specific task
- System displays a group chat interface for that task
- Shows:
  - Task details and description
  - Conversation history between humans and bots
  - Generated documents and outputs
  - Progress indicators
  - Participant list (humans and bots)

### 4. Document/Output View
- Within a task, users can view documents generated by the task, by clicking the header & seeing it expand. From there, it's a side-scrolling menu with Documents, Sub-tasks, and more.
- Example: For a book proposal task, users can see sub-tasks for each section
- Documents are dynamically generated and updated as the task progresses

## Key Features

### Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Categorize tasks
- Set recurrence patterns
- Mark tasks as complete

### Collaboration
- Add/remove human collaborators
- Assign/configure AI sub-agents for specific roles
- Real-time updates on collaborator activities

### AI Integration
- AI sub-agents automatically work on assigned tasks
- Different types of AI agents for different task types
- AI agents can generate documents, research, summaries, etc.
- Humans can review and provide feedback on AI work

### Progress Tracking
- Visual indicators of task progress
- Activity timeline
- Completion status of sub-tasks

### Document Generation
- Dynamic document creation based on task type
- Document templates for common tasks
- Version history and change tracking
- Export options for generated documents

## UI Components

### Tasks List
- Filterable/sortable list of tasks
- Category tabs (All, Inbox, Finance, Code, Recurring)
- Task cards with key information
- Add new task button

### Task Detail
- Header with task name and status
- Participant icons with role indicators
- Chat/collaboration area
- Document/output preview area
- Progress/activity timeline

### Document Viewer
- Rich text viewing capabilities
- Section navigation
- Edit/comment functionality
- Version history

## Technical Considerations
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Efficient state management for complex task hierarchies
- Integration with AI services for sub-agents
- Document generation and storage
- Notification system for task updates

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced AI agent configuration
- Custom task templates
- Integration with external tools and services
- Advanced analytics on task efficiency and completion
- Mobile-optimized experience
