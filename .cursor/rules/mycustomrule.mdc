# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

When creating components, put them in app/components, and import them like @/app/components/*

This is so that Tailwind works


## Spacing

Sometimes, putting things on the View does not work.

React Native styling is much more restrictive than the web. This code will work on the web, but not on React Native:



                    <View className="flex-row items-center space-x-3">
                        <Ionicons
                            name={item.icon}
                            size={24}
                            color={item.color || '#6b7280'}
                        />
                        <Text className={`text-base ${item.color ? '' : 'text-gray-800'}`} style={item.color ? { color: item.color } : undefined}>
                            {item.label}
                        </Text>
                    </View>

To fix this, we can remove space-x-3 and space it out by adding padding manually to the icon instead.
                  +          className="pr-3"

Another common gotcha: 

Colors do not cascade from views! So instead of doing this, prefer putting the color modifier on the text directly

export function App() {
  return (
    <View className="text-red-500">
      <Text>Hello, World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
